# PolyU-graduate-school-WhatsApp-chatbot-using-LLM,-LangChain,and-Twilio
In this project, I developed a chatbot for Hong Kong Polytechnic University graduate school information and inquiries. LangChain and Hugginface are used as the framework. LLma2 is the chosen LLM model along with llmIndex for context embedding. Flask to expose the endpoint of the model, and Twilo for the WhatsApp platform implementation. The whole model is packaged in a Dockerfile for endpoint deployment using cloud services.
* LangChain is used as the framework for coupling LLM model with external data source
